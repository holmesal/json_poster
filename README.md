JSON POSTer
===========

Chrome Extension Used to Send Post Requests With JSON Payload

I created this repo to get a better feel/understanding of chrome extension.  Also, I wanted to be able to copy/paste
Formatted JSON Data and send POST requests with ease.

## Install
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to *chrome://extensions/* in your Chrome browser
3. Click on *Load unpacked extension...*
4. Load the cloned repo root *json_poster*

## Using The Extension
1. Specify POST URL in *URL* input
2. Specify JSON Data in *JSON Data* input
3. Click Submit!

You can optionally save data via clicking the Save checkbox.  This will store the data for later use.  This data
can be loaded via the *Populate From Last Saved* button
